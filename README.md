This app hooks up to the YT API and displays results/allows for playback.

To do/Future updates:

- Implementing global searching (include multiple APIs from different platforms such as Dailymotion, Vimeo, and more). 
- Implement selective platform searching
- Implement playlists. Allow the user to save a particular video into custom playlists (tied to a Google OAuth and saved onto a JSON-server). Playlists can have videos from         various video hosting platforms, which as far as I'm aware no web application currently provides.
